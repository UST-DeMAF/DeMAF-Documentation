# Feature Branching Model:

1. There are **two** permanent branches per repository *main* and *dev*.

2. The default branch is *dev*.

3. A new feature branch **must** be forked from the current *dev* branch for the development of a new feature.

4. The name of the feature branch **must** be based on the respective ticket name.

5. Once work on a feature branch has been completed, a pull request **must** be placed on the *dev* branch.

6. Pull requests **must** be checked by at least one developer and pass the pipeline.
